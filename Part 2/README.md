# Part 2 Deliverable

### Instructions to run Part 2 C file
Unfortunately, there is no Makefile. Here are the steps to run program successfully:

1. Compile program with ``` gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c -lpthread ```
2. Run the executable with: ``` fibonacci <integerNumber> ``` 
Note: Fibonacci program only displays "0, 1, 0, 0, ...". Instead of displaying "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...". Couldn't find the logic error in the source code.
